              <p class="card-text">Event bubbling is a term my might have come across on my JavaScript travels. It relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the same event</p>

              <p class="card-text">Users can define a callback function as a function passed into another function as its parameter. In other words, users can define them as a function passed to another function as an argument termed a callback function..In JavaScript, we need to use a callback() function because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous. It indicates they do not stop the function or a program from executing until the purpose they contain inside them gets completed. Instead, the JavaScript engine will run it in the background while the other code of the JS program keeps running.</p>
